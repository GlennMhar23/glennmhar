      <div class="col-9"><p>The owner Mr Chavit Singson has a hunting hobby which becomes his agenda to set up the Baluarte. When his hunting collection trophy grew big he then decided to put up the Baluarte Zoo.

        This is on top of the hill inside the Baluarte. The Safari Gallery is a "trophy room" of Chavit Singson's collection of animals he hunted for years and years. It features the remains of real animals. You'll see the mounted head, just skin and the whole animals. Some are really massive that I wonder how did they bring it in there. They all look magnificently preserved.
        
        Some of the animals in the gallery are bison, wild beast, bear, elephant, lion and deer. Everything is well labelled and the gallery itself is designed flawlessly. And the good thing about this place is it is free for everyone to view. I was really fascinated when I first saw it. It's unbelievable.
        
        Here's what you can see in the gallery.</p></div>

Mayor Chavit Singson, as I heard made it free so that the people of Ilocos can come to the zoo and see the animals without the need to go to Manila.
          
            You will see animals you typically see in the zoo. You can feed the kangaroo, ride on the donkey, caressed the tiger or put a reptile on your hand or a snake in your shoulder while it slithers lol. They have an amazing interactive show like the wild boar painting and the Fur Sea Experience where you can feed the seals, watch their fantastic show and feed them. They are well-cared for as I see. They are very tamed and gentle. Just feel bad about the tigers chained up in the cage.
